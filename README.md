My name is Becka. I've been working in data for years, but only in Excel. I'm excited to learn more data tools. I used to live in Boston (and miss it so much), but moved to be with my fiance while he finishes his PhD. I love trying new restaurants, going to concerts, and travelling. My most recent trip was to Japan and I loved it so much - I already want to go back!
